# HackerRank Java Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various **HackerRank Java challenges**.  
Each problem is solved in a separate Java class, organized by topic when possible.  
The goal of this project is to practice Java, improve problem-solving skills, and share clean, working solutions.

---

## Structure
- `src/` — Source code directory. Each HackerRank problem is implemented in its own class.
- `README.md` — Project documentation.

---

## Naming Convention
- Each HackerRank problem has its own **Java class**.
- Class names are written in **PascalCase** based on the problem title.  
  Example: `JavaIfElse.java`, `JavaOutputFormatting.java`
- `easy/`, `medium/`, `hard/` — Each folder corresponds to a difficulty level.  
  Inside these folders, every HackerRank problem has its own Java class file.
